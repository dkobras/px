Description: automatically authenticate through proxies
 Px is a HTTP(s) proxy server that allows applications to authenticate through
 an NTLM or Kerberos proxy server, typically used in corporate deployments,
 without having to deal with the actual handshake.  It is primarily designed to
 run as a user-level service, and authenticates further applications using the
 user's credentials.
